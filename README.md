# Path of Exile Currency Economy Analysis

## Project Description
This project explores the evolving in-game currency economy of *Path of Exile* (Mercenaries League) using daily market snapshots. The analysis focuses on discovering trends, relationships, and outliers among currencies over time through data mining techniques such as clustering, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and anomaly detection. The goal is to provide insight into how the virtual economy changes across the league lifecycle.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [poe.ninja](https://poe.ninja/poe1/data), which provides daily snapshots of in-game currency values and market listings. Additional currency information can be found at [poe.db](https://poedb.com/).
